## Tinta ðŸŽ¨ 
Tinta (paint in Portuguese) is a personal project where I planned to build a ML model for sketch recognition
between multiple categories.

It is designed and built from the beginning with MLOps principles in mind, in order to getting the models 
into production, which in my case means, my own on-premise kubernetes cluster.
